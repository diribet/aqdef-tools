AQDEF tools is a Java library that can be used for reading, writing, creating and manipulating the AQDEF content. 
If you are not familiar with the AQDEF format, it would be better for you to take a look at the AQDEF documentation (see section [What is AQDEF](#what-is-aqdef))

### What is AQDEF

AQDEF stands for Advanced Quality Data Exchange Format.
It is a data format developed by Q-DAS® in cooperation with leading companies of the manufacturing industry.

AQDEF [documentation](https://www.q-das.com/en/service/data-format-aqdef) could be downloaded from the Q-DAS® website. 

### Motivation behind this project

We at [Diribet](https://www.diribet.com) believe that standardized and open data format is essential for creating successful information system architectures of Industry 4.0 adopters.
And because there already exists such a data format, we have decided to support it by open-sourcing this library.

We strongly believe in open source so this is our little payback to the community that gave us so much.
